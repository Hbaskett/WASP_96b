# WASP_96b
My scripts for WASP-96b Internship

check_burden - used to calculate the change in the amount of certian species through time

check_conservation - used to calculate the conservation of axial angular momentum and mass as well as the change in kinetic energy through time

check_eddy - used to calculate the zonal momentum budget using Denis's code apadted to my set up produces v similar plots to check_momentum

check_max_winds - used to plot the maximum value of each component of wind through time 

check_momentum - my method for calucualting the zonal momentum budget

check_toa_net_energy_flux - used to check the balance of energy at the top of atmosphere

plt_gif - compiles all time slices from any script into a single gif, also has code to make a set of directories

plt_mle_frac_on_plevs_along_latitudes - plots the vertical abundance profiles of CH4, NH3, H2O, CO, CO2 and HCN at a given time slice

plt_temp_on_plevs_along_latitudes - plots the PT structure at every time slice

plt_winds - plots contours of the zonal meridonal and vertical mean for the zonal meridonal and vertical components of the wind at every time slice
